# ADBS_FHO_JC_REMANDABAN

Use the HRM DATABASE for this project. 

Create a PHP project with database integration that exhibits the following features of an Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS):

I. Functional Requirements
The PHP project must exhibit the following core features of an HRMIS:

1. Adding New Employee Records:
- Record fields must be based on the complete data requirements of the CSC Form 212 (Revised 2025) - Personal Data Sheet.
- Field Validations must be included. Empty fields are strictly not allowed (use a default value, such as "Not Applicable" if a certain field is not suited to an employee).
- Notification: A clear notification of successful record addition must be displayed to the user.

2. Modify Records: Implement functionality to update existing employee data. Do not allow the modification of primary/foreign key values.

3. Search and View Records: Provide search capabilities based on key employee data, such as name or employee ID, and a detailed view page for each record.

4. Report Generation: Implement functionality to generate at least two (2) summary reports. Examples of reports are:
 A. List of employees list by department, civil status, etc.
 B. Employee's service report.
 C. Employee's training and development report.
 D. Employee's certifications and licenses report.

5. Deletion of Record: Implement functionality to permanently remove an employee record.

II. Non-Functional Requirements
The system must adhere to the following quality attributes:

1. Reliability and Data Integrity: Implement the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), particularly for critical multi-step database operations, to ensure transactional reliability.

2. SQL Injection Protection: All database queries (CRUD operations) must use secure methods, such as prepared statements (parameterized queries), to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

3. Role-Based Access: Access to features must be controlled based on the user's assigned role.
Roles: Employee, HR Staff, HR Head.
Example: Only HR Staff/HR Head can delete a record; an Employee can only view/modify their own record.

4. Activity Log Generation: Implement database trigger(s) to automatically record changes (ADD, MODIFY, DELETE) made to employee records, ensuring auditability.

III. Additional Features & Database Scope
Database Alterations: You are allowed to perform the following alterations on the existing HRM database:
1. Add new table/s for User/Role Management and Activity Log.
2. Modify existing data types.

The project will be evaluated based on the following characteristics and success definitions of the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Quality Model:

1. Functional Suitability (20 pts.)
Sub-Characteristics and HRMIS Project Success Definition
1.1. Completeness - The system must fully implement the core functional requirements and the non-functional requirements for all user roles.

1.2. Correctness - All data retrieved, modified, or added (especially the fields from CSC Form 212) must be stored and displayed with 100% accuracy. Reports must correctly aggregate and filter data.

1.3 Appropriateness - The system must allow an HR Staff to complete the process of adding a new employee (including all Form 212 fields and validations) in a reasonable, efficient time.

2. Interaction Capability (Usability) (10 pts.)

Sub-Characteristics and HRMIS Project Success Definition:

2.1. Recognizability - Key navigation elements (CRUD functions, Reports) must be clearly labeled and consistent across all user roles, easily found by new users.

2.2. Operability - Data forms (CSC Form 212) must use clear input controls to ensure ease of operation."

2.3. User Error Protection - The system must implement field validations for all required CSC Form 212 fields, displaying clear, non-technical error messages.
2.4. Aesthetics - The UI must use a clean, professional design with a consistent look and feel.

3. Security (10 pts.)
Sub-Characteristics and HRMIS Project Success Definition:

3.1 Confidentiality - Access must be strictly controlled by the Role-Based Access Control RBAC. An "Employee"" must be physically prevented from accessing administrative functions like "Delete Record".

3.2. Integrity - The system must use prepared statements/parameterized queries for all database operations to achieve 100% protection against SQL Injection.

3.2. Non-repudiation & Accountability - The Activity Log (generated by database triggers) must record the User ID, Action Performed, Timestamp, and the Affected Record ID for every operation that modifies data.


4. Maintainability (5 pts.)

Sub-Characteristics and HRMIS Project Success Definition:
4.1. Reusability - Database connection and core CRUD functions must be encapsulated in a dedicated, reusable class or module.

5. Reliability (5 pts.)
Sub-Characteristics and HRMIS Project Success Definition:

5.1. Maturity - The system must operate without encountering fatal PHP errors or database connection failures during standard use.
5.2. Recoverability - The implementation of ACID Properties (specifically Atomicity) ensures that any database transaction (even multi-step ones) either fully completes or is entirely rolled back, preventing corrupted records."
